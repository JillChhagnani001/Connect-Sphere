## Stakeholder Descriptions

### Investors / Owners  
They are stakeholders because their financial investment funds the entire project. The success or failure of ConnectSphere directly impacts their return on investment (ROI).

### Developer Team  
They are stakeholders because their work and expertise are what will build and maintain the platform. The project's success affects their job, daily tasks, and professional reputation.

### End Users  
They are the most important stakeholders because the platform is built for them. They are directly affected by every feature, bug, and policy. Their decision to use or abandon the app will determine its success.

### Content Creators & Influencers  
They are a special group of stakeholders because they have a professional or financial interest in the platform. They need specific tools to build an audience, and their presence on ConnectSphere will attract many other end users.

### System Administrators  
They are stakeholders because they are responsible for the health and safety of the platform. They are directly affected by the quality of the admin tools and are responsible for enforcing the rules that keep the community safe.

## Elicitation Techniques and Applications

### End Users  
- **Surveys**: Great for getting quantitative data (e.g., "What feature is most important?") from a large, diverse group of people. Surveys are scalable and provide broad insights into user preferences.  
- **Focus Groups**: A moderated discussion with a small group of potential users (5â€“10 people) to gather qualitative feedback on ideas, features, and designs. It's perfect for testing a new feature concept.  

### Content Creators / Influencers  
- **Surveys**: Great for getting quantitative data (e.g., "What feature is most important?") from a large, diverse group of people. Surveys are scalable and provide broad insights into user preferences.  
- **One-on-One Interviews**: A direct conversation to understand their specific needs, frustrations with other platforms, and what tools would help them create better content.  

### System Admin  
- **Document Analysis**: Document analysis ensures structured, complete, and regulation-compliant requirements are captured, and it directly informs the design of a robust admin dashboard for managing the social media platform.  

### Developer Team  
- **Prototyping**: Prototyping is suitable because it allows developers to visualize system features early, test feasibility, and gather feedback before full implementation.  
- **Brainstorming**:  
  1. Finds the Best Technical Solutions: It leverages the team's collective expertise to figure out how to build features efficiently.  
  2. Identifies Risks Early: It uncovers potential problems, security flaws, and performance issues before development begins.  
  3. Creates Team Ownership: It gives developers a voice in the solution, which improves motivation and leads to a better product.  

### Investors  
- **Presentation**: Showing them a high-level project plan or a prototype is a great way to elicit feedback. It makes the project tangible and helps confirm that your direction aligns with their vision. Their questions and reactions will reveal their priorities and concerns.  
- **Formal Interviews**: Allow requirement analysts to ask specific, business-focused questions such as:  
  - What monetization strategies are preferred (ads, premium memberships, subscriptions)?  
  - What analytics and reporting features are necessary to track platform growth?
  - What kind of scalability (user base, server capacity) do investors expect in the first 2-3 years?
